isent1: "There have been several legislative changes since 2010 aiming at the cementing of the power of Fidesz (the governing party) and at the creation of a parallel state. Many public office holders who are difficult to remove and who had received their mandates exclusively from the current government or Fidesz's parliamentary majority will retain their positions after the elections, regardless of their outcome."
isent2: "In case of a government change, these persons may well hinder the new government through their varied formal and informal means related to their positions. Such office holders are present in all corners of the state apparatus:"

    {{> chapter ds=endata id='legislative' title='Legislative' color='cl1' desc='The legislative is the supreme branch of power which can determine the operational framework of the other two branches as well through the adoption of legislation and the drawing up of the constitution. The legislative powers are exercised by the National Assembly. Two other institutions may be related to it, the Fiscal Council, since the Parliament may not adopt the national budget without the consent of the latter, and the State Audit Office, which checks the spending of grant funds from the central budget on behalf of the legislator. Following the elections of 2022, <strong>two high-level senior officers</strong> retain their positions.' }}

    {{> chapter ds=endata id='judiciary' title='Judiciary' color='cl2' desc='Although it is a branch independent from politics, it may, nevertheless, significantly affect the latter. On one hand, it prosecutes political corruption as part of the exercise of criminal jurisdiction, and, on the other hand, it may review and annul the decisions of administrative authorities subject to the executive through the functioning of jurisdiction in administrative matters. After the elections, <strong>three senior officers</strong> retain their positions.'}}

    {{> chapter ds=endata id='executive' title='Executive' color='cl3' desc='The supreme organ of the executive is the government, but in recent years several responsibilities that traditionally belong to the powers of the government or the executive have been outsourced to authorities which are formally independent from the actual government. The principal officers of those authorities may not receive any official instructions from, and may be removed by the government, only in a very limited number of cases. After the elections of 2022, <strong>six senior officers</strong> retain their positions.' }}

    {{> chapter ds=endata id='other' title='Other' color='cl4' desc='In the Hungarian constitutional system, there are several public office holders and organs that cannot be clearly classified as part of one branch of power, but which have important roles in maintaining the operability of the state, or function as checks and balances between other branches of power. If these organs exercise their powers in an obstructive manner that will not only limit the margin of maneuver of the government but may fundamentally jeopardize the operation of the state. Following the elections, <strong>21 senior officers</strong> retain their positions.' }}
